## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### iOS Issues

# 2. Verify provisioning profile matches bundle ID
# 3. Ensure correct team selected in Xcode

# Build failures
# 1. Clean build folder: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder
# 2. Delete derived data: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
# 3. Re-sync Capacitor: npx cap sync ios
```

### Android Issues
```bash
# Gradle build issues
./gradlew clean
rm -rf android/.gradle
rm -rf android/app/build

# Signing issues
# 1. Verify keystore passwords in gradle.properties
# 2. Check keystore file path
# 3. Ensure signing config matches build type

# Capacitor sync issues
npx cap clean android
npx cap sync android
```

### General Issues
```bash
# Dependency issues
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Capacitor issues
npx cap doctor
npx cap sync
```

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management
- **Never commit**: Keystore files, certificates, or passwords to version control
- **Use environment variables**: For sensitive configuration
- **Secure storage**: Store credentials in secure password managers
- **Team access**: Limit certificate access to authorized team members

### Build Security
- **Verify signatures**: Always verify signed builds before distribution
- **Secure build environment**: Use clean, secure machines for release builds
- **Audit dependencies**: Regularly audit npm and native dependencies
- **Monitor releases**: Set up monitoring for production app performance
